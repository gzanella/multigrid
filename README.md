# multigrid
Supporting code for the Rejoinder of the discussion paper "Multilevel Linear Models, Gibbs Samplers and Multigrid Decompositions" by Giacomo Zanella and Gareth Roberts.

This repository provides additional code to the one available in the supplementary material of the paper above published Bayesian Analysis.
In particular, it provides a code implementing the conditionally optimal parametrization and an optimized STAN implementation of the Poisson model provided by Bob Carpenter.
For more details see the rejoinder of the paper available on the Bayesian Analysis website.
